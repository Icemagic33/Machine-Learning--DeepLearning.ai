# Machine Learning Specialization by DeepLearning.AI and Stanford University

Welcome to my repository for the Machine Learning Specialization offered by DeepLearning.AI and Stanford University on Coursera. This repo contains all my course projects, assignments, and notes as I progress through the series.

## About the Specialization

This specialization is designed to help you break into AI, with a focus on mastering deep learning to open up numerous career opportunities. It covers a wide range of fundamental machine learning techniques including supervised and unsupervised learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning, and the practical application of these methods.

## Courses and Weekly Breakdown

### Course 1: Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification
- **Week 1:** Introduction to machine learning, linear regression, cost functions, and gradient descent.
- **Week 2:** Multiple linear regression, cost functions for multiple features, feature engineering, and polynomial regression.
- **Week 3:** Logistic regression, understanding classification vs. regression, regularization techniques to combat overfitting.

### Course 2: Advanced Learning Algorithms
- **Week 1:** Building neural networks for binary classification, neural network architectures, and vectorization.
- **Week 2:** Multi-class classification with neural networks, activation functions, and optimizations.
- **Week 3:** Data partitioning strategies, bias-variance trade-off, regularization, and data-centric AI approaches.
- **Week 4:** Decision trees, random forests, XGBoost, choosing between model types.

### Course 3: Unsupervised Learning and Recommender Systems
- **Week 1:** K-means clustering, anomaly detection, supervised vs unsupervised decision-making.
- **Week 2:** Building recommender systems using collaborative and content-based methods.
- **Week 3:** Constructing a deep reinforcement learning model (Deep Q Network).
